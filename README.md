Design Reasoning

Our game takes inspiration from classic 8-bit and 16-bit platformers. Growing up, we played Super Mario Bros, Mega Man Games, and Contra, and they had a massive impact on our game development. Older games often focused on tight controls and clear goals, and this project follows that by emphasizing speed, navigation, and awareness of the environment. Instead of enemies that deal damage, the large monsters in the game act as obstacles that slow the player down, keeping the game challenging. This supports a more momentum-based gameplay style while still fitting the feel of retro games. The different levels resemble the structured designs of older games. The main objective is to escape the game.  This reflects a classic motivation found in many retro games: keep moving, avoid setbacks, and reach the end. The game combines nostalgic visuals with smoother physics to create a modern take on a familiar style.

Additional Information

This game was built in Godot to maintain a lightweight, pixel‑friendly workflow and to emulate the simplicity of retro engines. All sound effects and visual styles were intentionally kept minimalistic to preserve the classic feel. Levels were designed to gradually increase difficulty through layout complexity rather than enemy aggression, emphasizing speed and game awareness. A game timer was also added to the game to add another component of rush in the game. The absence of damage systems also encourages exploration without penalty.  All assets are self-produced with the exception of the Super Grotto Escape Pack from the Unity Asset Store. Press engage to start (the small text on the left side of the screen).
